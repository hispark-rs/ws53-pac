# ws53-pac

Experimental WS53 application-core PAC. Register facts are owned by
[hisi-registers](https://github.com/hispark-rs/hisi-registers); generated Rust is
not edited by hand. The supported profile is `ws53_liteos_app`, MCU mode 1.
Only modeled peripherals are exposed; this is not a complete-chip claim.

Regenerate with `HISI_REGISTERS=/path/to/hisi-registers bash scripts/regen.sh`.
Requires svd2rust **0.37.1**, uv and the **nightly-2026-07-09** rustfmt. Ordinary Cargo builds need none of
the register-generation tools. `generation.json` records input hashes and the
source commit (including whether the source tree was dirty), formatter version,
and hashes of the generator recipe/settings as well as its outputs.
The recipe validates SVD against a pinned CMSIS schema and enables
`--max-cluster-size`: MDMA channels preserve the 0x20-byte stride, including
reserved tail padding. RX/TX FIFO views and interrupt-clear command views
intentionally restrict generated access APIs. These checks establish register
layout and API shape, not peripheral behavior or safe DMA buffer ownership.

`rt` supplies `device.x`. The custom interrupt controller is not a PLIC; IRQ
numbers are absolute HiSilicon local interrupt cause numbers. This PAC does not
initialize clocks, release the control core, or establish peripheral ownership.
